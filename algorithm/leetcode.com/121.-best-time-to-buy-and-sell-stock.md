## Brute force, Time Limit Exceeded

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        answer = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):
                profit = prices[j] - prices[i]
                if answer < profit:
                    answer = profit
        return answer

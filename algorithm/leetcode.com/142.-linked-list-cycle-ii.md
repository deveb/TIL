# 142. Linked List Cycle II

```python
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        node = head
        visited = []
        while node:
            if node in visited:
                return node

## **Floyd's Tortoise and Hare**

> Intuition  
> What happens when a fast runner \(a hare\) races a slow runner \(a tortoise\) on a circular track? At some point, the fast runner will catch up to the slow runner from behind.

```python
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # phase 1
        tortoise = head
        hare = head
        while hare and hare.next:
            tortoise = tortoise.next
            hare = hare.next.next
            if tortoise == hare:
                # phase 2
                ptr1 = head
                ptr2 = tortoise
                while ptr1 != ptr2:
                    ptr1 = ptr1.next
                    ptr2 = ptr2.next
                return ptr1
        return None
```

# Probability and Statistics: To p or not to p?

## week 1, Probability and Statistics: To p or not to p?

### 1.1 The Monty Hall Problem

A problem of decision making under uncertainty Concept of probability is doing what is optimal baseds on the available information In the long run, if you play through the probabilities, you're going to win far more often than you lose.

### 1.2 Decision Making Under Uncertainty

### 1.3 Uncertainty in the News

### 1.4 Simplicity vs. Complexity - The Need for Models

### 1.5 Safe to Assume? Beware, When Model Assumptions Go Wrong!

## week 2, Probability and Statistics: To p or not to p?

### 2.1 Probability Principles

Quantifying uncertainty with probability. Random experiment which result in various outcome, and the sample space is the set of all possible outcomes in that experiment. S = Sample space unit interval = \[0, 1\] Probability of Sample space P\(S\)

Probabilities may be determined

* subjectively
* experimentation
* theoretically

### 2.2 Simple Probability Distributions

### 2.3 Expectation of Random Variables

### 2.4 Bayesian Updating

### 2.5 Parameters

binary set of outcome. success and failure probability if success = pi

* mutually exclusive
* collectively exhaustive

Bernoulli distribution to situations where there are simplyt two possible outcomes

### 2.6 The Distribution Zoo

Binomial distribution

* dichotomy of outcomes
* constant probability of success
* fixed number of trials
* outcomes to be independent

Poisson distribution, number of occurences of some phenomenon per uniot of time or distance E\(x\) = lambda = rate parameter

## week 3, Probability and Statistics: To p or not to p?

### 3.1 Classify Your Variables!

statistical toolbox depending on the nature of variables nationality, categorical variable, no natural ordering

measurable variables, interval scale/ ratio scale

### 3.2 Data Visualisation

### 3.3 Descriptive Statistics - Measures of Central Tendency

### 3.4 Descriptive Statistics - Measures of Spread

### 3.5 The Normal Distribution

### 3.6 Variance of Random Variables
